# minesweeper

Port of [maxencelav/itesciaMinesweeper](https://github.com/maxencelav/itesciaMinesweeper) to Vite, to ensure my old code still runs somewhere!

Viewable at [https://maxencelav.github.io/minesweeper/](https://maxencelav.github.io/minesweeper/)!

Some edits have been made to the original code, such as:

- translation of the comments to English,
- the removal of jQuery and fixes to the code that used it,
- the handling of the game's theme system (one .less file that contains all the themes, and the switching is done by changing a data attribute on the body tag),
- better accessibility on the theme switcher,
- the third-party libraries used.

> [!INFO]
> You can check the changes I made by looking at the `2023 ADDITION` comments in the code.
